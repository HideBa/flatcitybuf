# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Basics in Rust

## Core Concepts

Test-Driven Development (TDD) follows this development cycle:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test first.
2. **Green**: Implement the minimum necessary code to pass the test.
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while ensuring tests still pass.

## Key Principles

- **Tests define the specification**: Test code expresses the expected behavior of the implementation.
- **Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern**:
  1. **Arrange**: Set up the necessary test environment.
  2. **Act**: Execute the functionality under test.
  3. **Assert**: Verify the expected result.
- **Test names should follow a "Condition → Action → Expected Result" format**. Example:
  - `"Given a valid token, retrieving user information should succeed"`

## Essential Tools for the Refactoring Phase

Once tests pass, use the following tools to refine your code:

### 1. **Static Analysis & Linting**
   - Run `cargo check` for type checking and borrow checking.
   - Use `cargo clippy` to detect potential issues and enforce best practices.

### 2. **Dead Code Detection & Removal**
   - Run `cargo deadlinks` to check for dead documentation links.
   - Use `cargo udeps` to find unused dependencies.
   - Run `cargo rustc -- -W dead_code` to detect unused functions.

### 3. **Code Coverage Analysis**
   - Install `cargo-tarpaulin` for test coverage measurement:
     ```bash
     cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
     cargo tarpaulin --out html
     ```
   - Open the generated HTML report to review coverage.

### 4. **Version Control with Git**
   - Commit after each phase (test creation → implementation → refactoring).
   - Review changes before committing:
     ```bash
     git status  # Check modified files
     git add <relevant files>
     git commit -m "<appropriate commit message>"
     ```
   - Use commit prefixes for clarity:
     - `test:` - Adding or modifying tests
     - `feat:` - Implementing new features
     - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
