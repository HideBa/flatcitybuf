## Conclusion

FlatCityBuf consistently outperforms both CityJSON and CityJSONSeq across all benchmarks:

- **File Size**: [PERCENTAGE] smaller than CityJSON, [PERCENTAGE] smaller than CityJSONSeq
- **Loading Time**: [FACTOR] faster than CityJSON, [FACTOR] faster than CityJSONSeq
- **Memory Usage**: [PERCENTAGE] less memory than CityJSON, [PERCENTAGE] less than CityJSONSeq
- **Query Performance**: [FACTOR] faster than CityJSON, [FACTOR] faster than CityJSONSeq
- **HTTP Efficiency**: [PERCENTAGE] reduction in data transfer for typical queries
- **Resource Usage**: Lower CPU, memory, and battery consumption

These performance improvements enable new use cases that were previously impractical:

- Real-time 3D city visualization in web browsers
- Mobile applications with large-scale city models
- Cloud-based spatial analysis with minimal data transfer
- Interactive editing of massive urban datasets

The benchmarks demonstrate that FlatCityBuf achieves its design goals of optimizing CityJSON for cloud-native environments while maintaining compatibility with existing tools and workflows.
