## Next Steps (Immediate Focus)

1. Fix the remaining node splitting test in tree_tests.rs
   - Determine if it tests a critical feature or can be modified
   - Investigate why it behaves differently from bulk loading
2. Fix compilation issues in HTTP implementation
   - Focus on fixing the expected signature for AsyncBufferedHttpRangeClient
   - Complete integration of async operations with sync BTreeIndex trait
3. Implement collision handling for string keys with same prefix
4. Optimize memory usage in internal data structures
5. Add comprehensive unit tests for HTTP-based access
6. Integrate with FlatCityBuf header structure

## Performance Goals
