# FlatCityBuf B-tree Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of the B-tree attribute indexing system for FlatCityBuf.

## Completed Items

### Core Components
- [x] Defined error types using `thiserror` instead of `anyhow`
- [x] Implemented `KeyEncoder` trait for different data types:
  - [x] `IntegerKeyEncoder` for numeric types
  - [x] `FloatKeyEncoder` for floating point with NaN handling
  - [x] `StringKeyEncoder` with fixed-width prefix
  - [x] `TimestampKeyEncoder` for date/time values
- [x] Designed fixed-size B-tree node structure
  - [x] Internal and leaf node types
  - [x] Linked list structure for leaf nodes
- [x] Implemented `Entry` type for key-value pairs

### Storage
- [x] Defined `BlockStorage` trait for abstraction
- [x] Implemented in-memory storage backend (`MemoryBlockStorage`)
- [x] Implemented file-based storage with LRU caching (`CachedFileBlockStorage`)
- [x] Designed page-aligned I/O operations (4KB blocks)

### B-tree Implementation
- [x] Implemented core `BTree<K, S>` structure
- [x] Added support for opening existing B-trees
- [x] Implemented bottom-up bulk loading via `BTreeBuilder`
- [x] Implemented exact match and range query algorithms

### Query System
- [x] Designed query condition types
  - [x] Exact match, range, comparison operations
  - [x] Set membership, prefix matching, custom predicates
- [x] Implemented query building API
- [x] Added `QueryExecutor` for handling multiple indices
- [x] Defined interfaces for B-tree and R-tree integration
- [x] Added selectivity-based query planning

### Testing & Examples
- [x] Added API usage examples
- [x] Set up basic test infrastructure

## In Progress
- [ ] Fix linter errors in query implementation (Debug+Clone trait issues)
- [ ] Optimize LRU cache implementation for thread safety
- [ ] Implement prefetching for sequential leaf node access

## Pending Items

### Core Implementation
- [ ] Complete `Node` serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Implement collision handling for string keys with same prefix
- [ ] Optimize memory usage in internal data structures

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Benchmark and optimize cache sizes
- [ ] Tune prefetching strategies
- [ ] Implement bulk query operations
- [ ] Add batch processing for multiple operations

### HTTP Support
- [ ] Design range request batching strategy
- [ ] Implement HTTP-based storage backend
- [ ] Add progressive loading support
- [ ] Optimize for web-based access patterns

### Integration
- [ ] Integrate with FlatCityBuf header structure
- [ ] Add support for multiple attribute indices
- [ ] Implement combined queries with R-tree (spatial)
- [ ] Add feature extraction from query results

### Documentation & Testing
- [ ] Add detailed documentation for all public APIs
- [ ] Create more comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Add benchmarking for performance comparison with BST
- [ ] Create examples for common use cases

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining linter errors in the query implementation
2. Complete the serialization/deserialization logic
3. Implement the thread-safe LRU cache
4. Add unit tests for key components
5. Begin implementing the HTTP-specific optimizations

## Performance Goals

- 5-10x fewer system calls compared to BST approach
- 80-95% cache hit rates for typical query patterns
- Support for files exceeding available memory
- Efficient operation over both local storage and HTTP
