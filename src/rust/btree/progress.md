# FlatCityBuf B-tree Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of the B-tree attribute indexing system for FlatCityBuf.

## Completed Items

### Core Components

- [x] Defined error types using `thiserror` instead of `anyhow`
- [x] Implemented `KeyEncoder` trait for different data types:
  - [x] `IntegerKeyEncoder` for numeric types
  - [x] `FloatKeyEncoder` for floating point with NaN handling
  - [x] `StringKeyEncoder` with fixed-width prefix
  - [x] `TimestampKeyEncoder` for date/time values
- [x] Designed fixed-size B-tree node structure
  - [x] Internal and leaf node types
  - [x] Linked list structure for leaf nodes
- [x] Implemented `Entry` type for key-value pairs

### Storage

- [x] Defined `BlockStorage` trait for abstraction
- [x] Implemented in-memory storage backend (`MemoryBlockStorage`)
- [x] Implemented file-based storage with LRU caching (`CachedFileBlockStorage`)
- [x] Designed page-aligned I/O operations (4KB blocks)

### B-tree Implementation

- [x] Implemented core `BTree<K, S>` structure
- [x] Added support for opening existing B-trees
- [x] Implemented bottom-up bulk loading via `BTreeBuilder`
- [x] Implemented exact match and range query algorithms

### Query System

- [x] Designed query condition types
  - [x] Exact match, range, comparison operations
  - [x] Set membership, prefix matching, custom predicates
- [x] Implemented query building API
- [x] Added `QueryExecutor` for handling multiple indices
- [x] Defined interfaces for B-tree and R-tree integration
- [x] Added selectivity-based query planning

### HTTP Support

- [x] Added basic HTTP client interface integration
- [x] Implemented `HttpBlockStorage` with caching
- [x] Created `HttpBTreeReader` for remote B-trees
- [x] Added metrics collection for HTTP operations

### Testing & Examples

- [x] Added API usage examples
- [x] Set up basic test infrastructure

## In Progress

- [x] Expand KeyEncoder implementations
  - [x] Add support for all integer types (i32, i16, i8, u64, u32, u16, u8)
  - [x] Add support for Float<f32>
  - [x] Add support for Bool
  - [x] Add support for date/time types (NaiveDateTime, NaiveDate, DateTime<Utc>)
- [ ] Fix compilation issues in HTTP implementation
  - [x] Resolve Rust borrowing issues with HTTP client
  - [ ] Fix expected signature for AsyncBufferedHttpRangeClient
- [ ] Integrate async operations with sync BTreeIndex trait
- [ ] Add support for cancellation in HTTP operations
- [ ] Complete unit tests for HTTP-based access

## Pending Items

### Core Implementation

- [ ] Complete `Node` serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Implement collision handling for string keys with same prefix
- [ ] Optimize memory usage in internal data structures
- [ ] Add more LruCache fixes where needed (proper mutable borrowing)

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Benchmark and optimize cache sizes
- [ ] Tune prefetching strategies
- [ ] Implement bulk query operations
- [ ] Add batch processing for multiple operations

### HTTP Support

- [ ] Implement range request batching strategy
- [ ] Add progressive loading support
- [ ] Optimize for web-based access patterns
- [ ] Implement advanced caching with TTL and size limits

### Integration

- [ ] Integrate with FlatCityBuf header structure
- [ ] Add support for multiple attribute indices
- [ ] Implement combined queries with R-tree (spatial)
- [ ] Add feature extraction from query results

### Documentation & Testing

- [x] Created simple test case for key encoders
- [ ] Add detailed documentation for all public APIs
- [ ] Create more comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Add benchmarking for performance comparison with BST
- [ ] Create examples for common use cases

## Next Steps

1. Implement and test B-tree for local file system
2. Optimize file I/O operations for disk-based storage
3. Fix remaining LruCache issues in file-based storage
4. Add comprehensive unit tests for file-based operations
5. Integrate with FlatCityBuf core format

## Performance Goals

- 5-10x fewer system calls compared to BST approach
- 80-95% cache hit rates for typical query patterns
- Support for files exceeding available memory
- Efficient operation over both local storage and HTTP
- Reduced memory usage during bulk loading operations
