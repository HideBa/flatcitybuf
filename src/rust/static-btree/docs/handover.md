# Static B-Tree Implementation - Task Handover Document

## Current Status

We've successfully implemented and tested a partition-based range search for the Static B+Tree data structure. The implementation is now complete with:

- `find_exact` function for exact key matches
- `find_partition` helper function to find the position where a key would be inserted
- `find_range` function with efficient range search capabilities
- Comprehensive unit tests for all functions

## Tree structure

The tree is stored in a flat array of `NodeItem`s. The hierarchy looks like this:

```
[Entry { key: 18, offset: 1 }]
level 2:
[Entry { key: 6, offset: 4 }, Entry { key: 12, offset: 6 }, Entry { key: 18446744073709551615, offset: 10 }]
level 1:
[Entry { key: 2, offset: 11 }, Entry { key: 4, offset: 13 }, Entry { key: 8, offset: 17 }, Entry { key: 10, offset: 19 }, Entry { key: 14, offset: 23 }, Entry { key: 16, offset: 25 }, Entry { key: 18446744073709551615, offset: 29 }]
level 0:
[Entry { key: 0, offset: 0 }, Entry { key: 1, offset: 16 }, Entry { key: 2, offset: 32 }, Entry { key: 3, offset: 48 }, Entry { key: 4, offset: 64 }, Entry { key: 5, offset: 80 }, Entry { key: 6, offset: 96 }, Entry { key: 7, offset: 112 }, Entry { key: 8, offset: 128 }, Entry { key: 9, offset: 144 }, Entry { key: 10, offset: 160 }, Entry { key: 11, offset: 176 }, Entry { key: 12, offset: 192 }, Entry { key: 13, offset: 208 }, Entry { key: 14, offset: 224 }, Entry { key: 15, offset: 240 }, Entry { key: 16, offset: 256 }, Entry { key: 17, offset: 272 }, Entry { key: 18, offset: 288 }]
```

## Search strategies

### Exact match

To find an exact match, we traverse nodes level by level, starting from the root node.
We compare the search key with the `NodeItem`s in the current level, and find where the search key is greater than the current node key. If it finds where the search key is greater than the current node key, it will search the right children node. If the search key is less than leftmost key in the node, it will search the left children node. Otherwise, it will search the middle children node.

### Range search

For range searches, we use a more efficient partition-based approach:
1. Find the partition points for both the lower and upper bounds of the range
2. Process only the leaf nodes between these partition points
3. Filter the items within those leaf nodes to return only those within the range

This approach minimizes tree traversals by locating the start and end points directly, then processing only the relevant leaf nodes. For single-key ranges (where lower == upper), we delegate to the `find_exact` function.

## Next Task: Payload and Duplicates Handling

According to the [progress.md](./progress.md) file, the next milestone (#4) involves implementing payload and duplicates handling in the tree.

### Implementation Steps

1. Modify the tree structure to support handling of payloads:
   - Update the `Entry` struct to include payload information or references
   - Consider how payloads will be stored and accessed efficiently

2. Add duplicate key handling:
   - Decide on a strategy for duplicate keys (linked list, array of values, etc.)
   - Modify the `find_exact` and `find_range` functions to return all matching entries for duplicate keys

3. Update the tree construction process:
   - Modify `generate_nodes` to handle duplicate keys correctly during tree construction
   - Ensure that nodes with duplicate keys are properly connected

4. Create unit tests for both payloads and duplicates:
   - Tests for storing and retrieving payloads
   - Tests for handling multiple entries with the same key
   - Edge cases like all entries having the same key

### Helpful Files and Functions

- `src/stree.rs`: Contains the main tree implementation
- `src/entry.rs`: Defines the Entry structure
- `src/key.rs`: Contains the Key trait implementation
- Look at the existing `find_exact` and `find_range` functions as examples
- The `num_original_items` and `payload_start` fields in the Stree struct are currently unused but likely intended for payload/duplicate handling

### Design Considerations

- Consider that this is a static tree, so all keys and their payloads must be known at construction time
- Ensure that the implementation remains memory-efficient
- Maintain the existing API design patterns for consistency
- Keep the Eytzinger layout for optimal binary search performance 

### Future Integration

After completing this task, the next milestone (#5) will involve implementing the HTTP query functionality, so ensure that the payload handling design will work well with streaming use cases.

## Useful Resources

- Check the [implementation_plan.md](./implementation_plan.md) document for the overall design strategy
- The existing tests in the `tests` module within `stree.rs` provide good examples
- The codebase follows the approach used in FlatGeobuf, which might provide additional insights

Good luck with the implementation!
