## Current Status

All core functionality is implemented and tested, including:

1. Memory-efficient data structures for a static B+tree
2. Support for implicit node indexing to reduce memory footprint
3. Configurable branching factor
4. Support for various key types
5. Search and range query operations
6. Proper handling of duplicate key values
7. Comprehensive unit tests

The basic implementation is complete and working. The next steps involve adding storage backends and caching to make the B+tree more versatile and integrate it with different environments.

## Next Tasks

The following tasks should be completed next to extend the functionality of the static B+tree:

### 1. Storage Implementation

Implement a generic storage interface similar to the one in the `btree` crate but optimized for static B+trees:

```rust
pub trait BTreeStorage {
    /// Read a node at the given index
    fn read_node(&self, node_index: usize) -> Result<Vec<u8>>;

    /// Write a node at the given index
    fn write_node(&mut self, node_index: usize, data: &[u8]) -> Result<()>;

    /// Get the node size in bytes
    fn node_size(&self) -> usize;

    /// Get the total number of nodes
    fn node_count(&self) -> usize;

    /// Flush any pending writes
    fn flush(&mut self) -> Result<()>;
}
```

This abstraction will allow the static B+tree to work with different storage backends:

1. **In-Memory Storage**: Optimized for fast access but limited by available RAM
   - Simple Vec-based implementation
   - Fast but non-persistent

2. **File-Based Storage**: For persistent storage on local filesystems
   - Memory-mapped file access for efficient I/O
   - Support for both read-only and read-write modes
   - Ability to build and query trees larger than available RAM

3. **HTTP-Based Storage**: For accessing remote trees over HTTP
   - HTTP range requests to fetch only required nodes
   - Client-side caching to minimize network traffic
   - Support for authentication and compression

### 2. Caching Implementation

Implement a caching layer to optimize access patterns:

```rust
pub struct CachedStorage<S: BTreeStorage> {
    storage: S,
    cache: LruCache<usize, Vec<u8>>,
    prefetch_strategy: PrefetchStrategy,
}
```

Key features to implement:

1. **LRU Cache**: Maintain most recently used nodes in memory
   - Configurable cache size
   - Eviction policies based on access patterns

2. **Prefetching Strategies**:
   - Sequential prefetching for range queries
   - Pattern-based prefetching for common access patterns
   - Adaptive prefetching based on observed access patterns

3. **Cache Statistics**:
   - Hit/miss rates
   - Prefetch effectiveness
   - Memory usage tracking

### 3. Integration with CityJSON Features

After implementing storage and caching:

1. Create adapter layer for CityJSON attribute indexing
2. Optimize for CityJSON specific use cases
3. Benchmark performance with real CityJSON datasets
4. Document best practices for different dataset sizes

### Implementation Guidelines

For developers continuing this work:

1. Follow the existing code style and error handling patterns
2. Maintain compatibility with the current B+tree interface
3. Write comprehensive tests for each storage backend
4. Benchmark different configurations for performance comparison
5. Document the trade-offs between different storage and caching strategies

The implementation should prioritize:

- Correctness: Ensure consistent results across storage backends
- Performance: Optimize for read-heavy workloads
- Memory efficiency: Minimize RAM usage for large datasets
- Flexibility: Allow for different deployment scenarios
