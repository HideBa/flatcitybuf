# Static B+tree Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of implementing the static B+tree data structure.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Planning and Setup ✅

- [x] Define requirements and goals
- [x] Create crate structure
- [x] Set up Cargo.toml with dependencies
- [x] Create README.md with documentation
- [x] Design module structure

### Phase 2: Core Data Structures ✅

- [x] Implement error types
- [x] Implement Entry structure for key-value pairs
- [x] Design and implement Node structure
- [x] Design and implement key encoding interface
- [x] Implement utility functions

### Phase 3: Tree Construction and Traversal ✅

- [x] Implement implicit node indexing
- [x] Implement tree building algorithm
- [x] Implement tree traversal for exact match queries
- [x] Implement range queries
- [x] Add support for different key types

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation ✅

- [x] Write unit tests for Entry
- [x] Write unit tests for Node
- [x] Write unit tests for key encoders
- [x] Write unit tests for tree building
- [x] Write unit tests for search operations
- [x] Write unit tests for range queries

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Profile and optimize tree construction
- [ ] Profile and optimize search operations
- [ ] Implement SIMD optimizations
- [ ] Add benchmarks for comparing against other B+tree implementations

### Phase 6: Additional Features

- [ ] Implement storage backends
- [ ] Implement HTTP backend for remote trees
- [ ] Add serialization/deserialization for trees
- [ ] Create CLI tools for tree operations

## Current Status

All core functionality is implemented and tested, including:

1. Memory-efficient data structures for a static B+tree
2. Support for implicit node indexing to reduce memory footprint
3. Configurable branching factor
4. Support for various key types
5. Search and range query operations
6. Comprehensive unit tests

The basic implementation is now complete and ready for use. Future work will focus on performance optimizations, particularly SIMD operations, and additional features such as storage backends and serialization.

## Next Steps

1. Optimize tree construction for large datasets
2. Implement SIMD-based key comparison
3. Develop storage backends for persistent trees
4. Add benchmarking tools for performance analysis
